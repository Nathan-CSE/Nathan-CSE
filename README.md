## Hi there!

I'm Nathan, a Computer Science student at the University of New South Wales. Currently I'm working as a Telemetry Systems Engineer for Sunswift Racing and leading the software team for UNSW Illuminate. In my spare time, I enjoy honing my photography skills and working on various personal projects.

Feel free to check out my portfolio website [here](https://nathan-cse.github.io/) and reach out via my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-aus/)!
